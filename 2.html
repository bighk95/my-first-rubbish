    <br><h2>2. The Chelsea legend</h2>

    <p>There are a lot of legends in Chelsea.
        They are all committed to the team and affectionate.<br>
        I would like to inform you that the legendary players 
        I introduce are part of the legendary players <br>
        and have been selected only by my preference.</p>

    <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Didier Drogba</li>
            <li>Frank Lampard</li>
            <li>Michael Ballack</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <p><h3>Didier Droggba</h3>
        He played for Chelsea for eight seasons<br>
        It was so popular that I didn't miss the best player in Africa.<br>
        He scored 163 goals for Chelsea.<br>

    <p><h3>Frank Lampard</h3>
        He played for Chelsea for 10 seasons from 04-05.<br>
        and was the pillar of the team in the absence of captain John Terry.<br>
        Despite being a midfielder, he scored a lot. he nicknamed the middle-riker<br>

    <p><h3>Michael Ballack</h3>
        I think there may be people who wonder about putting Michael Ballack in a legendary player.<br>
        But I'd like to ask how many Chelsea players have as much affection for the team as Ballack.<br>
        Ballack loved the team and was the only sub player to hold the pole in an important game.<br>
        He wanted to stay at Chelsea with a weekly cut, but the boards refused to accept it.<br>
