    <h2>1. How to I know this marvelous team</h2>
    <p>When I was in middle school and high school,<br>
    The Korean player named <b>Park Ji-sung</b> played for a team called 
    Manchester United in EPL.<br>I happened to encounter Chelsea 
    while watching Park Ji-sung's game.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Chelsea then came as a big shock to me.<br>
    Fantastic, aggressive, thick-boned, unsophisticated but powerful.<br>
    The highest ranking at the time team 
    as Arsenal and Manchester United were like peacocks<br>
    but Chelsea were like bears.</p>
