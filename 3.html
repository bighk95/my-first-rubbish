    <ul>
        <li>Patience for the Manager</li>
        <li>Belief in the Scout</li>
        <li>Biased Attack Position</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>1. Patience for the Manager</h3>
    Thomas Tuchel had 62 wins, 19 draws and 18 losses in 99 games, but he sacked.<br>
    The decision was to discredit Chelsea fans.<br>
    Chelsea boards need to be more patient with the manager.</p><br>

    <p><h3>2. Belief in the Scout</h3>
    Chelsea often miss a genius player, because they scouted a promising player and couldn't trust the scout.<br>
    Kevin De Bruyne, Ronaldo not Christiano, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Cesc Fabregas is one of those players.<br>
    Chelsea seem to need to trust the scouts.<br></p>

    <br>
    <p><h3>3. Biased Attack Position</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Right</td>
            <td>43.5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Middle</td>
            <td>38.5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Left</td>
            <td>18%</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    As you can see in the table above, Chelsea have such a 
    low proportion of left-handed attacks that they are feared 
    to be destroyed by their opponents.</p>
